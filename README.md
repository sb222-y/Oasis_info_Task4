# ðŸŒ¦ Weather App

This is a simple **Weather Application** built using **Python** and the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
The app allows users to fetch real-time weather information for any city in the world.



## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Fetches **current weather** details of a city.
- Displays:
  - **Temperature (Â°C)**
  - **Humidity (%)**
  - **Weather condition** (e.g., Clear Sky, Rain, etc.)
- Handles **invalid city names** with proper error messages.
- Uses **OpenWeatherMap API** for real-time data.



## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The user enters the **city name**.
2. The app makes an API request to **OpenWeatherMap**.
3. The weather data (temperature, humidity, condition) is displayed on the terminal.



## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Requests library** for HTTP requests
- **OpenWeatherMap API**
